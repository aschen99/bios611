# Affect of Technology Usage on Mental Health

## Introduction

Increased usage of technology and social media has sparked concerns about its affect on mental health, particularly in adolescents and young adults. It has been heavily debated whether high usage of social media is linked with poor mental health statuses. Some studies have found no correlation between social media use and mental health while others have identified a negative association (Berryman et al., 2018).

Using a data set from Kaggle, we will use the data to explore whether or not increased technology and social media use is associated varying mental health statuses.

## Summary of results

![](./figures/Tech_boxplot.png) The above figures depicts how technology use varied across different mental health statuses (excellent, fair, good, and poor). However we notice that the data behaves unnaturally as the average technology use hours is almost equal across all groups.

![](./figures/tech_hours_density.png) To check for normality, we then created a density curve to show the distribution of the technology usage hours in this data set. Given the large sample size of this data set (n=10000), we would expect the data to approximate to a normal distribution, however, figure below displays a uniform distribution instead.

![](./figures/sm_density.png) For comparison, we created another density curve for social media usage hours. We notice a similar trend where the data shows a uniform distribution instead of approximating to a normal distribution. Additionally, we compared the average social media usage hours across all groups of reported stress level (low, medium, high). The average social media usage hours was almost equal across all stress level groups. ![](./figures/SM_boxplot.png)

![](./figures/gaming_hist.png) Similarly, the histogram for gaming hours also displays a uniform distribution. This further proves that the data is unnatural and analysis of this data will result in an invalid conclusion.

## Conclusion

Based on the patterns that we have noted in this data set, we can conclude that this data is unnatural given how we typically expect data to behave. It is unnatural for average technology use hour and social media use hours to be equal across all variable groups.

Additionally, given the large sample size, it is unusual for the data to not approximate to a normal distribution.
